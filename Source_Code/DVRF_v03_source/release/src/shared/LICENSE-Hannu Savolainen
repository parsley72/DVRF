 * Nicolas Pitre <nico@cam.org>, 1999/04/14 :
 *   Little mods for all variable to reside either into rodata or bss segments
 *   by marking constant variables with 'const' and initializing all the others
 *   at run-time only.  This allows for the kernel uncompressor to run
 *   directly from Flash or ROM memory on embedded systems.
