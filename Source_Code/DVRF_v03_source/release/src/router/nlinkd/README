This package "nlinkd" is used to listen messages from kernel with netlink socket.

It just response 2 kind of message:  
- Wireless warning page URL request.
- Parentral control for non-HTTP traffic URL request.

then, it will return "PASS"-or-"BLOCK" result to the kernel, which filter the traffics accordingly.
