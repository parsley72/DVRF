	* Makefile (all): make config.h before making $(PPTP_BIN). 
	* Makefile (config.h): truncate the file if it exists before
	inputing to it - '>' instead of '>>'

Mon Mar 11 12:48:16 2002  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* DEVELOPERS: add mailing lists.
	* Makefile (CFLAGS): remove PPPD_BINARY and PPTP_LINUX_VERSION in
	favour of a config.h file.
	* Makefile (config.h): create config.h from Makefile variables
	* Makefile (PPTP_DEPS): add config.h
	* pptp.c: include config.h
	* version.c: include config.h
	* util.c (PROGRAM_NAME): no longer used by two programs, change
	PROGRAM_NAME to default to pptp.
	* Makefile (CFLAGS): remove -DPROGRAM_NAME

Fri Mar  8 11:56:00 2002  mulix  <mulix@actcom.co.il>

	* TODO: remove notes about compiler warnings, as all compiler
	warnings are now gone.
	* pptp.c (main): add volatile qualifier to some variables to
	silence gcc warnings 'variable might be clobbered by longjmp or
	vfork'. add note explaining why volatile and that it should be
	removed when the longjmp is removed.
	* pptp_callmgr.c (main): likewise. 
	* inststr.c (inststr): break up "ptr += strlen(++ptr)" which is
	undefined behaviour into two expressions. 
	* pptp.c (main): initialize callmgr_sock to -1 since it might be
	used uninitialized otherwise. 
	* pptp_ctrl.c (pptp_dispatch_ctrl_packet): #ifdef 0 two unused
	variables referring to the current packet, which should not be
	simply erased, as we might want to use them in the future.
	* util.c: add missing #include.
