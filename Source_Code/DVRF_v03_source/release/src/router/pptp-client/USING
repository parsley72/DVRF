pptp is started as a psuedo-tty child process using pppd's pty option:

	pppd call provider [pppd-options] \
	pty "/usr/sbin/pptp hostname --nolaunchpppd [pptp-options]"

where hostname is the host name or IP address of the PPTP server.

pptp can also start pppd itself:

	pptp hostname [pptp-options] [pppd-options]

Note the unusual order of arguments, the hostname comes before the
pptp options, and the pppd options come last.

So, for example:

	pptp my.pptp.host debug name cananian \
	remotename ntdialup 172.18.0.2:172.18.0.3

	route add -net 172.18.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 172.18.0.3

You will see three pptp-related processes in your process list: a call
manager, a GRE/PPP en/decapsulator, and pppd.  To shut down the pptp
connection, kill the pppd process.

NOTE THAT PPTP MUST BE RUN AS ROOT.

Most trouble with pptp will probably be due to incorrect pppd
configuration.  Be sure you thoroughly understand MS-CHAP support in
pppd.  Use the 'debug' option to pppd to log connection information;
this will help you trouble-shoot the pppd side of pptp.

QUIRKS HANDLING:

Some ADSL providers and some ADSL hardware are buggy or not conforming
to the RFC, and require special handling.  To this end, pptp supports
a 'quirks' mechanism.  Currently, only '--quirks BEZEQ_ISRAEL' is
defined, for connecting to Bezeq (the Israeli phone company) ADSL
service.

Only *some* of the equipment used by Bezeq needs this option, but even
the equipment that does not need it works fine with it.  If you use
Bezeq, you probably want the '--quirks BEZEQ_ISRAEL' switch.

More information on Bezeq's ADSL service can be found at
