 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.	This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.	Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.	For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.	If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.	For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy	<name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
			    Preamble 
 
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public 
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This 
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to 
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by 
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to 
your programs, too. 
 
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not 
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you 
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for 
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it 
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it 
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. 
 
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether 
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that 
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights. 
 
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the software. 
 
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we 
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so 
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
authors' reputations. 
 
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software 
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free 
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the 
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any 
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow. 
  
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains 
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed 
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, 
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" 
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: 
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, 
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another 
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in 
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of 
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program 
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
 
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's 
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the 
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion 
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and 
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 
 
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices 
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any 
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third 
    parties under the terms of this License. 
 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively 
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such 
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an 
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a 
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide 
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under 
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this 
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but 
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on 
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 
  
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, 
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of 
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
the scope of this License. 
 
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, 
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your 
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete 
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
    customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer 
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is 
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you 
    received the program in object code or executable form with such 
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source 
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a 
special exception, the source code distributed need not include 
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as 
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 
compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
  
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is 
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under 
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such 
parties remain in full compliance. 
 
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
 
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further 
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to 
this License. 
 
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot 
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent 
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by 
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then 
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is 
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made 
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
be a consequence of the rest of this License. 
  
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License 
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding 
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates 
the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 
 
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of 
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation. 
 
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author 
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes 
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals 
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
			    NO WARRANTY 
 
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY 
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN 
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE 
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest 
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least 
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> 
 
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify 
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by 
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or 
    (at your option) any later version. 
 
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, 
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of 
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the 
    GNU General Public License for more details. 
 
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License 
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software 
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA 
 
 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this 
when it starts in an interactive mode: 
 
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author 
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'. 
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it 
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details. 
 
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may 
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names: 
 
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker. 
 
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 
  Ty Coon, President of Vice 
 
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General 
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

Version 2.0 -  August 6, 2003        
        
Please read this License carefully before downloading this software.  By downloading or using this software, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this License.  If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this License, please do not download or use the software.        
        
Apple Note:  In January 2007, Apple changed its corporate name from "Apple Computer, Inc." to "Apple Inc."  This change has been reflected below and copyright years updated, but no other changes have been made to the APSL 2.0.        
        
1.	General; Definitions.  This License applies to any program or other work which Apple Inc. ("Apple") makes publicly available and which contains a notice placed by Apple identifying such program or work as "Original Code" and stating that it is subject to the terms of this Apple Public Source License version 2.0 ("License").  As used in this License:        
        
1.1	 "Applicable Patent Rights" mean:  (a) in the case where Apple is the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to Apple and (ii) that cover subject matter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent necessary to use, reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code without infringement; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject matter in Your Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code.        
        
1.2	"Contributor" means any person or entity that creates or contributes to the creation of Modifications.        
        
1.3	 "Covered Code" means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof.        
        
1.4	"Externally Deploy" means: (a) to sublicense, distribute or otherwise make Covered Code available, directly or indirectly, to anyone other than You; and/or (b) to use Covered Code, alone or as part of a Larger Work, in any way to provide a service, including but not limited to delivery of content, through electronic communication with a client other than You.        
        
1.5	"Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.        
        
1.6	"Modifications" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof.  When code is released as a series of files, a Modification is:  (a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing Covered Code; and/or (b) any new file or other representation of computer program statements that contains any part of Covered Code.         
        
1.7	"Original Code" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work as originally made available by Apple under this License, including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made available by Apple under this License, and that has been expressly identified by Apple as such in the header file(s) of such work; and (b) the object code compiled from such Source Code and originally made available by Apple under this License        
        
1.8	"Source Code" means the human readable form of a program or other work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable (object code).        
        
1.9	"You" or "Your" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this License.  For legal entities, "You" or "Your" includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, You, where "control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.        
        
2.	Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions.   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:        
        
2.1	Unmodified Code.  You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance:        
        
(a)	You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and        
        
(b) 	You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.        
        
2.2	Modified Code.  You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also meet all of these conditions:        
        
(a)	You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code;         
        
(b)	You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; and        
        
(c)	If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom You have Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available.  Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth in this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site).        
        
2.3	Distribution of Executable Versions.  In addition, if You Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code.          
        
2.4	Third Party Rights.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code.        
        
3.	Your Grants.  In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.          
        
4.	Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.         
        
5.	Limitations on Patent License.   Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein.  Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.          
        
6.	Additional Terms.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.         
        
7.	Versions of the License.  Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.  Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Apple.  No one other than Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.          
        
8.	NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT.  The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works.  The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk.  THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.  You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.        
        
9.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).        
        
10.	Trademarks.  This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names  "Apple", "Mac", "Mac OS", "QuickTime", "QuickTime Streaming Server" or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor.  You agree not to use any Apple Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.          
        
11.	Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor.  Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License.  Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.          
        
12.	Termination.          
        
12.1	Termination.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:        
        
(a)	automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach;        
(b)	immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or        
(c)	automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an action for patent infringement against You in that instance.        
        
12.2	Effect of Termination.  Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code.  All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License.  Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13.  No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.        
        
13. 	Miscellaneous.        
        
13.1	Government End Users.   The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined in FAR 2.101.  Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation).  Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.        
        
13.2	Relationship of Parties.  This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.        
        
13.3	Independent Development.   Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.        
        
13.4	Waiver; Construction.  Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.        
        
13.5	Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect.  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.        
        
13.6	Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.        
        
13.7	Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law.         
        
Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies:  The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English.  Les parties ont exig? que le pr?sent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient r?dig?s en anglais.

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
 
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

		       Version 2, June 1991      
      
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,      
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA      
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies      
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.      
      
			    Preamble      
      
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your      
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public      
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free      
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This      
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software      
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to      
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by      
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to      
your programs, too.      
      
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not      
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you      
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for      
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it      
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it      
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.      
      
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid      
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.      
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you      
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.      
      
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether      
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that      
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the      
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their      
rights.      
      
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and      
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,      
distribute and/or modify the software.      
      
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain      
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free      
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we      
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so      
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original      
authors' reputations.      
      
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software      
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free      
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the      
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any      
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.      
      
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and      
modification follow.      
      
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE      
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION      
      
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains      
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed      
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,      
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"      
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:      
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,      
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another      
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in      
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".      
      
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not      
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of      
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program      
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the      
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).      
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.      
      
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's      
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you      
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate      
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the      
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;      
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License      
along with the Program.      
      
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and      
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.      
      
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion      
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and      
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1      
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      
      
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices      
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.      
      
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in      
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any      
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third      
    parties under the terms of this License.      
      
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively      
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such      
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an      
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a      
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide      
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under      
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this      
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but      
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on      
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)      
      
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If      
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,      
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in      
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those      
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you      
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based      
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of      
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the      
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.      
      
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest      
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to      
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or      
collective works based on the Program.      
      
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program      
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of      
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under      
the scope of this License.      
      
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,      
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of      
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:      
      
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable      
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections      
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,      
      
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three      
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your      
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete      
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be      
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium      
    customarily used for software interchange; or,      
      
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer      
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is      
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you      
    received the program in object code or executable form with such      
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)      
      
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for      
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source      
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any      
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to      
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a      
special exception, the source code distributed need not include      
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary      
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the      
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component      
itself accompanies the executable.      
      
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering      
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent      
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as      
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not      
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.      
      
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program      
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt      
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is      
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.      
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under      
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such      
parties remain in full compliance.      
      
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not      
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or      
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are      
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by      
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the      
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and      
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying      
the Program or works based on it.      
      
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the      
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the      
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to      
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further      
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.      
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to      
this License.      
      
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent      
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),      
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or      
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not      
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot      
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this      
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you      
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent      
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by      
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then      
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to      
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.      
      
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under      
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to      
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other      
circumstances.      
      
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any      
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any      
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the      
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is      
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made      
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed      
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that      
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing      
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot      
impose that choice.      
      
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to      
be a consequence of the rest of this License.      
      
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in      
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the      
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License      
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding      
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among      
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates      
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.      
      
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions      
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will      
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to      
address new problems or concerns.      
      
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program      
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any      
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions      
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free      
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of      
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software      
Foundation.      
      
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free      
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author      
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free      
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes      
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals      
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and      
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.      
      
			    NO WARRANTY      
      
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY      
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN      
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES      
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED      
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF      
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS      
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE      
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,      
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.      
      
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING      
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR      
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,      
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING      
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED      
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY      
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER      
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE      
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.      
      
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS      
      
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs      
      
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest      
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it      
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.      
      
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest      
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively      
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least      
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.      
      
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>      
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>      
      
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify      
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by      
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or      
    (at your option) any later version.      
      
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,      
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of      
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the      
    GNU General Public License for more details.      
      
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along      
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,      
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.      
      
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.      
      
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this      
when it starts in an interactive mode:      
      
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author      
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.      
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it      
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.      
      
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate      
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may      
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be      
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.      
      
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your      
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if      
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:      
      
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program      
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.      
      
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989      
  Ty Coon, President of Vice      
      
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into      
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may      
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the      
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General      
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

		       Version 2, June 1991     
     
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,     
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA     
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies     
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.     
     
			    Preamble     
     
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your     
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public     
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free     
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This     
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software     
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to     
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by     
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to     
your programs, too.     
     
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not     
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you     
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for     
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it     
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it     
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.     
     
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid     
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.     
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you     
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.     
     
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether     
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that     
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the     
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their     
rights.     
     
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and     
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,     
distribute and/or modify the software.     
     
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain     
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free     
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we     
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so     
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original     
authors' reputations.     
     
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software     
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free     
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the     
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any     
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.     
     
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and     
modification follow.     
     
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE     
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION     
     
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains     
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed     
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,     
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"     
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:     
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,     
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another     
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in     
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".     
     
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not     
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of     
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program     
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the     
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).     
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.     
     
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's     
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you     
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate     
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the     
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;     
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License     
along with the Program.     
     
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and     
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.     
     
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion     
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and     
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1     
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:     
     
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices     
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.     
     
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in     
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any     
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third     
    parties under the terms of this License.     
     
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively     
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such     
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an     
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a     
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide     
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under     
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this     
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but     
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on     
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)     
     
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If     
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,     
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in     
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those     
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you     
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based     
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of     
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the     
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.     
     
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest     
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to     
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or     
collective works based on the Program.     
     
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program     
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of     
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under     
the scope of this License.     
     
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,     
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of     
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:     
     
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable     
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections     
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,     
     
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three     
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your     
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete     
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be     
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium     
    customarily used for software interchange; or,     
     
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer     
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is     
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you     
    received the program in object code or executable form with such     
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)     
     
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for     
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source     
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any     
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to     
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a     
special exception, the source code distributed need not include     
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary     
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the     
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component     
itself accompanies the executable.     
     
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering     
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent     
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as     
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not     
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.     
     
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program     
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt     
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is     
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.     
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under     
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such     
parties remain in full compliance.     
     
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not     
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or     
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are     
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by     
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the     
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and     
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying     
the Program or works based on it.     
     
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the     
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the     
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to     
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further     
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.     
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to     
this License.     
     
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent     
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),     
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or     
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not     
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot     
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this     
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you     
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent     
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by     
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then     
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to     
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.     
     
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under     
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to     
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other     
circumstances.     
     
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any     
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any     
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the     
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is     
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made     
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed     
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that     
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing     
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot     
impose that choice.     
     
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to     
be a consequence of the rest of this License.     
     
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in     
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the     
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License     
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding     
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among     
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates     
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.     
     
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions     
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will     
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to     
address new problems or concerns.     
     
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program     
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any     
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions     
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free     
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of     
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software     
Foundation.     
     
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free     
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author     
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free     
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes     
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals     
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and     
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.     
     
			    NO WARRANTY     
     
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY     
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN     
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES     
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED     
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF     
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS     
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE     
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,     
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.     
     
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING     
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR     
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,     
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING     
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED     
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY     
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER     
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE     
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.     
     
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     
     
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs     
     
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest     
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it     
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.     
     
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest     
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively     
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least     
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.     
     
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>     
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>     
     
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify     
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by     
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or     
    (at your option) any later version.     
     
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,     
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of     
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     
    GNU General Public License for more details.     
     
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along     
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,     
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.     
     
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.     
     
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this     
when it starts in an interactive mode:     
     
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author     
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.     
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it     
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.     
     
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate     
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may     
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be     
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.     
     
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your     
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if     
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:     
     
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program     
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.     
     
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989     
  Ty Coon, President of Vice     
     
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into     
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may     
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the     
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General     
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the

the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to     
your programs, too.     
     
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION     
     
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains     
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed     
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,     
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"     
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:     
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,     
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another     
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in     
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".     
     
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not     
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of     
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program     
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the     
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).     
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.     
     
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's     
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you     
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate     
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and     
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.     
     
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion     
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and     
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1     
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:     
     
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices     
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.     
     
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in     
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any     
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third     
    parties under the terms of this License.     
     
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively     
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such     
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an     
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a     
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide     
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under     
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this     
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but     
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on     
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)     
     
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If     
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,     
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in     
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those     
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you     
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based     
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of     
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the     
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.     
     
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest     
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to     
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or     
collective works based on the Program.     
     
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program     
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of     
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under     
the scope of this License.     
     
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,     
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of     
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:     
     
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable     
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections     
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,     
     
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three     
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your     
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete     
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be     
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium     
    customarily used for software interchange; or,     
     
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer     
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is     
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you     
    received the program in object code or executable form with such     
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)     
     
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for     
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source     
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any     
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to     
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a     
special exception, the source code distributed need not include     
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary     
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the     
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component     
itself accompanies the executable.     
     
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering     
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent     
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as     
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not     
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.     
     
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program     
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt     
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is     
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.     
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under     
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such     
parties remain in full compliance.     
     
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not     
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or     
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are     
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by     
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the     
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and     
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying     
the Program or works based on it.     
     
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the     
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the     
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to     
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further     
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.     
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to     
this License.     
     
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent     
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),     
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or     
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not     
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot     
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this     
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you     
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent     
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by     
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then     
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to     
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.     
     
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under     
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to     
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other     
circumstances.     
     
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any     
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any     
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the     
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is     
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made     
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed     
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that     
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing     
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot     
impose that choice.     
     
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to     
be a consequence of the rest of this License.     
     
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in     
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the     
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License     
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding     
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among     
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates     
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.     
     
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions     
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will     
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to     
address new problems or concerns.     
     
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program     
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any     
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions     
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free     
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of     
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software     
Foundation.     
     
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free     
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author     
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free     
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes     
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals     
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and     
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.     
     
			    NO WARRANTY     
     
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY     
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN     
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES     
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED     
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF     
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS     
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE     
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,     
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.     
     
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING     
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR     
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,     
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING     
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED     
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY     
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER     
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE     
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.     
     
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     
     
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs     
     
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest     
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it     
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.     
     
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest     
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively     
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least     
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.     
     
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>     
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>     
     
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify     
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by     
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or     
    (at your option) any later version.     
     
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,     
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of     
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     
    GNU General Public License for more details.     
     
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along     
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,     
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.     
     
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.     
     
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this     
when it starts in an interactive mode:     
     
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author     
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.     
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it     
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.     
     
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate     
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may     
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be     
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.     
     
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your     
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if     
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:     
     
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program     
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.     
     
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989     
  Ty Coon, President of Vice     
     
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into     
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may     
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the     
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General     
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
			    Preamble 
 
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public 
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This 
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to 
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by 
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to 
your programs, too. 
 
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not 
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you 
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for 
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it 
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it 
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. 
 
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether 
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that 
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights. 
 
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the software. 
 
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we 
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so 
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
authors' reputations. 
 
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software 
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free 
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the 
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any 
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow. 
  
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains 
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed 
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, 
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" 
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: 
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, 
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another 
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in 
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of 
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program 
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
 
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's 
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the 
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion 
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and 
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 
 
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices 
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any 
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third 
    parties under the terms of this License. 
 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively 
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such 
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an 
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a 
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide 
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under 
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this 
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but 
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on 
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 
  
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, 
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of 
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
the scope of this License. 
 
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, 
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your 
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete 
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
    customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer 
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is 
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you 
    received the program in object code or executable form with such 
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source 
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a 
special exception, the source code distributed need not include 
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as 
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 
compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
  
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is 
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under 
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such 
parties remain in full compliance. 
 
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
 
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further 
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to 
this License. 
 
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot 
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent 
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by 
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then 
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is 
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made 
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
be a consequence of the rest of this License. 
  
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License 
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding 
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates 
the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 
 
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of 
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation. 
 
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author 
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes 
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals 
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
			    NO WARRANTY 
 
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY 
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN 
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE 
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest 
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least 
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> 
 
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify 
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by 
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or 
    (at your option) any later version. 
 
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, 
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of 
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the 
    GNU General Public License for more details. 
 
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License 
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software 
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA 
 
 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this 
when it starts in an interactive mode: 
 
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author 
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'. 
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it 
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details. 
 
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may 
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names: 
 
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General 
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains

refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"

above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any 
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third 
    parties under the terms of this License. 
 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively

themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of 
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
the scope of this License. 
 
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, 
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your 
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete 
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
    customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer 
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is 
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you 
    received the program in object code or executable form with such 
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source 
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a 
special exception, the source code distributed need not include 
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as 
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 
compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
  
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is 
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under 
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such 
parties remain in full compliance. 
 
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
 
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further 
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to 
this License. 
 
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot 
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent 
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by 
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then 
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is 
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made 
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
be a consequence of the rest of this License. 
  
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License 
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding 
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates 
the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 
 
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of 
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation. 
 
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author 
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes 
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals 
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
			    NO WARRANTY 
 
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY 
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN 
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE 
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  
	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest 
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least 
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author> 
 
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify 
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by 
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or 
    (at your option) any later version. 
 
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, 
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of 
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the 
    GNU General Public License for more details. 
 
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License 
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software 
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. 
 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this 
when it starts in an interactive mode: 
 
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author 
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'. 
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it 
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details. 
 
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may 
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names: 
 
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General 
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
     59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA. 
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
			    Preamble 
 
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public 
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This 
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to 
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by 
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to 
your programs, too. 
 
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not 
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you 
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for 
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it 
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it 
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. 
 
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether 
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that 
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights. 
 
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the software. 
 
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we 
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so 
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
authors' reputations. 
 
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software 
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free 
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the 
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any 
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow. 
  
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains 
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed 
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, 
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" 
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: 
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, 
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another 
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in 
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of 
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program 
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
 
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's 
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the 
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion 
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and 
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 
 
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices 
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any 
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third 
    parties under the terms of this License. 
 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively 
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such 
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an 
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a 
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide 
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under 
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this 
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but 
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on 
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 
  
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, 
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of 
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
the scope of this License. 
 
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, 
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your 
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete 
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
    customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer 
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is 
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you 
    received the program in object code or executable form with such 
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source 
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a 
special exception, the source code distributed need not include 
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as 
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 
compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
  
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is 
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under 
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such 
parties remain in full compliance. 
 
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
 
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further 
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to 
this License. 
 
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot 
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent 
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by 
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then 
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is 
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made 
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
be a consequence of the rest of this License. 
  
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License 
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding 
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates 
the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 
 
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of 
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation. 
 
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author 
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes 
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals 
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
			    NO WARRANTY 
 
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY 
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN 
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE 
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  
	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest 
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least 
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author> 
 
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify 
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by 
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or 
    (at your option) any later version. 
 
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, 
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of 
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the 
    GNU General Public License for more details. 
 
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License 
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, 
    Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA. 
 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this 
when it starts in an interactive mode: 
 
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author 
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'. 
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it 
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details. 
 
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may 
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names: 
 
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker. 
 
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 
  Ty Coon, President of Vice 
 
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General 
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

			    Preamble     
     
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your     
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public     
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free     
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This     
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software     
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to     
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by     
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to     
your programs, too.     
     
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not     
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you     
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for     
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it     
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it     
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.     
     
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid     
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.     
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether

you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and     
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,     
distribute and/or modify the software.     
     
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain     
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free     
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we     
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so     
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original     
authors' reputations.     
     
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software     
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free     
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the     
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any     
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.     
     
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and     
modification follow.     
     
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE     
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION     
     
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains     
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed     
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,     
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"     
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:     
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,     
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another     
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in     
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".     
     
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not     
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of     
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program     
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the     
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).     
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.     
     
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's     
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you     
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate     
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the     
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;     
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License     
along with the Program.     
     
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and     
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.     
     
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion     
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and     
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1     
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:     
     
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices     
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.     
     
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in     
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any     
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third     
    parties under the terms of this License.     
     
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively     
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such     
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an     
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a     
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide     
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under     
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this     
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but     
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on     
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)     
     
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If     
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,     
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in     
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those     
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you     
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based     
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of     
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the     
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.     
     
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest     
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to     
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or     
collective works based on the Program.     
     
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program     
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of     
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under     
the scope of this License.     
     
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,     
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of     
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:     
     
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable     
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections     
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,     
     
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three     
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your     
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete     
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be     
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium     
    customarily used for software interchange; or,     
     
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer     
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is     
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you     
    received the program in object code or executable form with such     
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)     
     
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for     
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source     
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any     
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to     
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a     
special exception, the source code distributed need not include     
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary     
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the     
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component     
itself accompanies the executable.     
     
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering     
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent     
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as     
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not     
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.     
     
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program     
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt     
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is     
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.     
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under     
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such     
parties remain in full compliance.     
     
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not     
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or     
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are     
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by     
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the     
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and     
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying     
the Program or works based on it.     
     
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the     
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the     
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to     
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further     
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.     
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to     
this License.     
     
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent     
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),     
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or     
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not     
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot     
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this     
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you     
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent     
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by     
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then     
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to     
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.     
     
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under     
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to     
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other     
circumstances.     
     
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any     
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any     
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the     
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is     
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made     
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed     
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that     
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing     
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot     
impose that choice.     
     
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to     
be a consequence of the rest of this License.     
     
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in     
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the     
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License     
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding     
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among     
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates     
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.     
     
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions     
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will     
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to     
address new problems or concerns.     
     
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program     
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any     
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions     
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free     
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of     
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software     
Foundation.     
     
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free     
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author     
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free     
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes     
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals     
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and     
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.     
     
			    NO WARRANTY     
     
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY     
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN     
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES     
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED     
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF     
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS     
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE     
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,     
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.     
     
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING     
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR     
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,     
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING     
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED     
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY     
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER     
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE     
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.     
     
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     
     
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs     
     
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest     
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it     
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.     
     
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest     
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively     
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least     
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.     
     
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>     
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>     
     
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify     
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by     
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or     
    (at your option) any later version.     
     
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,     
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of     
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     
    GNU General Public License for more details.     
     
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along     
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,     
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.     
     
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.     
     
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this     
when it starts in an interactive mode:     
     
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author     
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.     
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it     
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.     
     
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate     
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may     
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be     
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.     
     
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your     
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if     
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:     
     
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program     
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.     
     
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989     
  Ty Coon, President of Vice     
     
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into     
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may     
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the     
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General     
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

   ATTORNEY-CLIENT   RELATIONSHIP.   CREATIVE   COMMONS   PROVIDES   THIS
   INFORMATION  ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
   REGARDING  THE  INFORMATION  PROVIDED,  AND  DISCLAIMS  LIABILITY  FOR
   DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.

   License

   THE  WORK  (AS  DEFINED  BELOW)  IS  PROVIDED  UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
   CREATIVE  COMMONS  PUBLIC  LICENSE  ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
   PROTECTED  BY  COPYRIGHT  AND/OR  OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
   WORK  OTHER  THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
   PROHIBITED.

   BY  EXERCISING  ANY  RIGHTS  TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
   AGREE  TO  BE  BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS
   YOU  THE  RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
   SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

   1. Definitions
    a. "Collective  Work"  means  a  work,  such  as  a periodical issue,
       anthology  or  encyclopedia,  in which the Work in its entirety in
       unmodified  form,  along  with  a  number  of other contributions,
       constituting  separate  and  independent  works in themselves, are
       assembled  into  a  collective  whole.  A  work that constitutes a
       Collective  Work  will  not  be  considered  a Derivative Work (as
       defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    b. "Derivative  Work"  means  a  work based upon the Work or upon the
       Work  and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
       arrangement,   dramatization,   fictionalization,  motion  picture
       version,    sound   recording,   art   reproduction,   abridgment,
       condensation,  or  any other form in which the Work may be recast,
       transformed,  or  adapted,  except  that a work that constitutes a
       Collective  Work  will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
       purpose  of  this  License.  For the avoidance of doubt, where the
       Work   is   a   musical   composition   or  sound  recording,  the
       synchronization  of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
       ("synching")  will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose
       of this License.
    c. "Licensor"  means  the  individual  or entity that offers the Work
       under the terms of this License.
    d. "Original  Author"  means the individual or entity who created the
       Work.
    e. "Work"  means  the  copyrightable work of authorship offered under
       the terms of this License.
    f. "You"  means  an individual or entity exercising rights under this
       License  who has not previously violated the terms of this License
       with  respect  to the Work, or who has received express permission
       from  the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
       previous violation.
    g. "License   Elements"   means   the  following  high-level  license
       attributes  as  selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of
       this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.

   2.  Fair  Use  Rights.  Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
   limit,  or  restrict  any  rights arising from fair use, first sale or
   other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
   copyright law or other applicable laws.

   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
   Licensor  hereby  grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
   perpetual  (for  the  duration of the applicable copyright) license to
   exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
    a. to  reproduce  the  Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
       Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
       Collective Works;
    b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
    c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
       publicly,  and  perform  publicly  by  means  of  a  digital audio
       transmission  the  Work  including  as  incorporated in Collective
       Works;
    d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
       publicly,  and  perform  publicly  by  means  of  a  digital audio
       transmission Derivative Works.
    e. For   the  avoidance  of  doubt,  where  the  work  is  a  musical
       composition:
         i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives
            the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
            performance   rights   society   (e.g.  ASCAP,  BMI,  SESAC),
            royalties  for  the  public  performance  or  public  digital
            performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
        ii. Mechanical  Rights  and  Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives
            the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
            music  rights  society  or  designated  agent (e.g. Harry Fox
            Agency),  royalties  for  any phonorecord You create from the
            Work   ("cover  version")  and  distribute,  subject  to  the
            compulsory  license  created  by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
            Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
    f. Webcasting  Rights  and  Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
       doubt,  where  the  Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
       exclusive   right  to  collect,  whether  individually  or  via  a
       performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
       public  digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
       the  compulsory  license  created  by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
       Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
   known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
   such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
   in  other  media  and  formats.  All  rights  not expressly granted by
   Licensor are hereby reserved.

   4.  Restrictions.The  license  granted in Section 3 above is expressly
   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
    a. You   may  distribute,  publicly  display,  publicly  perform,  or
       publicly  digitally  perform the Work only under the terms of this
       License,  and  You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
       Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
       Work  You  distribute,  publicly  display,  publicly  perform,  or
       publicly  digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
       on  the  Work  that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
       the  recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
       not  sublicense  the  Work.  You must keep intact all notices that
       refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may
       not  distribute,  publicly  display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally  perform  the  Work with any technological measures that
       control  access  or  use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
       the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work
       as  incorporated  in  a Collective Work, but this does not require
       the  Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject
       to  the  terms  of  this License. If You create a Collective Work,
       upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
       remove  from  the Collective Work any credit as required by clause
       4(c),  as  requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
       from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
       the  Derivative  Work  any  credit  as required by clause 4(c), as
       requested.
    b. You   may  distribute,  publicly  display,  publicly  perform,  or
       publicly  digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms
       of  this  License,  a  later version of this License with the same
       License  Elements  as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons
       license  that  contains  the same License Elements as this License
       (e.g.  Attribution-ShareAlike  2.5 Japan). You must include a copy
       of,  or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other
       license  specified  in  the  previous  sentence with every copy or
       phonorecord  of  each  Derivative  Work  You  distribute, publicly
       display,  publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may
       not  offer  or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter
       or  restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise
       of  the  rights  granted  hereunder,  and You must keep intact all
       notices  that  refer  to  this  License  and  to the disclaimer of
       warranties.  You  may  not  distribute, publicly display, publicly
       perform,  or  publicly  digitally perform the Derivative Work with
       any  technological measures that control access or use of the Work
       in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.
       The  above  applies  to  the  Derivative Work as incorporated in a
       Collective  Work,  but  this  does not require the Collective Work
       apart  from  the  Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the
       terms of this License.
    c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally  perform  the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective
       Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
       provide,  reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
       the  name  of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
       supplied,  and/or  (ii)  if  the  Original  Author and/or Licensor
       designate  another  party  or  parties  (e.g. a sponsor institute,
       publishing   entity,   journal)   for  attribution  in  Licensor's
       copyright  notice,  terms of service or by other reasonable means,
       the  name  of  such  party  or  parties;  the title of the Work if
       supplied;  to  the  extent  reasonably  practicable,  the  Uniform
       Resource  Identifier,  if  any,  that  Licensor  specifies  to  be
       associated  with  the  Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
       copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the
       case  of  a  Derivative  Work, a credit identifying the use of the
       Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work
       by  Original  Author,"  or  "Screenplay  based on original Work by
       Original   Author").   Such  credit  may  be  implemented  in  any
       reasonable  manner;  provided,  however,  that  in  the  case of a
       Derivative  Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will
       appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in
       a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
       credit.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

   UNLESS  OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
   THE  WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
   CONCERNING  THE  MATERIALS,  EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
   INCLUDING,  WITHOUT  LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
   FITNESS  FOR  A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
   LATENT  OR  OTHER  DEFECTS,  ACCURACY,  OR  THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
   ERRORS,  WHETHER  OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
   THE  EXCLUSION  OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
   TO YOU.

   6.   Limitation  on  Liability.  EXCEPT  TO  THE  EXTENT  REQUIRED  BY
   APPLICABLE  LAW,  IN  NO  EVENT  WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
   LEGAL  THEORY  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
   EXEMPLARY  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
   EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination
    a. This  License  and  the  rights  granted  hereunder will terminate
       automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
       Individuals  or  entities  who  have  received Derivative Works or
       Collective  Works  from  You under this License, however, will not
       have  their  licenses  terminated  provided  such  individuals  or
       entities  remain  in full compliance with those licenses. Sections
       1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    b. Subject  to  the  above  terms and conditions, the license granted
       here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
       the  Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right
       to  release  the  Work  under  different  license terms or to stop
       distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
       election  will  not  serve  to withdraw this License (or any other
       license  that  has  been,  or is required to be, granted under the
       terms  of  this  License),  and this License will continue in full
       force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous
    a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or
       a  Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license
       to  the  Work  on  the  same  terms  and conditions as the license
       granted to You under this License.
    b. Each   time   You  distribute  or  publicly  digitally  perform  a
       Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
       original  Work  on  the  same  terms and conditions as the license
       granted to You under this License.
    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
       of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
       action  by  the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
       reformed  to  the  minimum extent necessary to make such provision
       valid and enforceable.
    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
       breach  consented  to  unless  such  waiver or consent shall be in
       writing  and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
       consent.
    e. This  License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
       with   respect   to   the   Work   licensed  here.  There  are  no
       understandings,  agreements or representations with respect to the
       Work  not  specified  here.  Licensor  shall  not  be bound by any
       additional  provisions  that  may appear in any communication from
       You.  This  License may not be modified without the mutual written
       agreement of the Licensor and You.

   Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty
   whatsoever  in  connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be
   liable  to  You  or  any  party  on  any  legal theory for any damages
   whatsoever,   including   without  limitation  any  general,  special,
   incidental  or  consequential  damages  arising  in connection to this
   license.  Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
   Commons  has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
   shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

   Except  for  the  limited purpose of indicating to the public that the
   Work  is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark
   "Creative  Commons"  or  any  related  trademark  or  logo of Creative
   Commons  without  the  prior  written consent of Creative Commons. Any
   permitted   use   will   be   in  compliance  with  Creative  Commons'
   then-current  trademark  usage  guidelines, as may be published on its

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA 
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
			    Preamble 
 
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public 
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This 
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to 
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by 
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to 
your programs, too. 
 
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not 
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you 
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for 
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it 
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it 
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. 
 
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether 
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that 
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights. 
 
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the software. 
 
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we 
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so 
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
authors' reputations. 
 
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software 
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free 
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the 
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any 
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow. 
  
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains 
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed 
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, 
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" 
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: 
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, 
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another 
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in 
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of 
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program 
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
 
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's 
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the 
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion 
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and 
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 
 
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices 
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any 
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third 
    parties under the terms of this License. 
 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively 
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such 
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an 
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a 
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide 
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under 
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this 
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but 
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on 
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 
  
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, 
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of 
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
the scope of this License. 
 
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, 
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your 
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete 
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
    customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer 
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is 
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you 
    received the program in object code or executable form with such 
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source 
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a 
special exception, the source code distributed need not include 
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as 
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 
compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
  
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is 
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under 
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such 
parties remain in full compliance. 
 
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
 
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further 
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to 
this License. 
 
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot 
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent 
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by 
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then 
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is 
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made 
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
be a consequence of the rest of this License. 
  
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License 
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding 
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates 
the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 
 
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of 
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation. 
 
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author 
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes 
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals 
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
			    NO WARRANTY 
 
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY 
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN 
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE 
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest 
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least 
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> 
 
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify 
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by 
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or 
    (at your option) any later version. 
 
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, 
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of 
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the 
    GNU General Public License for more details. 
 
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License 
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software 
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA 
 
 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this 
when it starts in an interactive mode: 
 
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author 
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'. 
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it 
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details. 
 
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may 
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names: 
 
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker. 
 
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 
  Ty Coon, President of Vice 
 
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General 
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is

be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free

make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,     
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA     
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies     
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.     
     
			    Preamble     
     
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your     
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public     
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free     
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This     
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software     
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to     
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by     
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to     
your programs, too.     
     
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not     
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you     
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for     
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it     
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it     
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.     
     
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid     
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.     
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you     
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.     
     
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether     
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that     
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the     
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their     
rights.     
     
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and     
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,     
distribute and/or modify the software.     
     
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain     
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free     
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we     
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so     
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original     
authors' reputations.     
     
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software     
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free     
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the     
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any     
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.     
     
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and     
modification follow.     
     
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE     
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION     
     
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains     
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed     
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,     
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"     
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:     
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,     
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another     
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in     
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".     
     
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not     
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of     
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program     
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the     
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).     
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.     
     
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's     
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you     
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate     
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the     
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;     
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License     
along with the Program.     
     
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and     
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.     
     
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion     
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and     
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1     
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:     
     
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices     
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.     
     
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in     
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any     
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third     
    parties under the terms of this License.     
     
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively     
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such     
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an     
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a     
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide     
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under     
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this     
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but     
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on     
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)     
     
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If     
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,     
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in     
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those     
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you     
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based     
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of     
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the     
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.     
     
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest     
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to     
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or     
collective works based on the Program.     
     
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program     
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of     
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under     
the scope of this License.     
     
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,     
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of     
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:     
     
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable     
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections     
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,     
     
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three     
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your     
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete     
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be     
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium     
    customarily used for software interchange; or,     
     
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer     
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is     
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you     
    received the program in object code or executable form with such     
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)     
     
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for     
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source     
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any     
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to     
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a     
special exception, the source code distributed need not include     
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary     
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the     
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component     
itself accompanies the executable.     
     
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering     
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent     
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as     
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not     
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.     
     
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program     
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt     
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is     
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.     
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under     
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such     
parties remain in full compliance.     
     
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not     
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or     
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are     
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by     
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the     
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and     
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying     
the Program or works based on it.     
     
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the     
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the     
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to     
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further     
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.     
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to     
this License.     
     
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent     
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),     
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or     
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not     
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot     
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this     
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you     
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent     
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by     
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then     
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to     
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.     
     
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under     
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to     
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other     
circumstances.     
     
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any     
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any     
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the     
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is     
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made     
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed     
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that     
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing     
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot     
impose that choice.     
     
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to     
be a consequence of the rest of this License.     
     
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in     
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the     
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License     
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding     
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among     
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates     
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.     
     
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions     
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will     
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to     
address new problems or concerns.     
     
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program     
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any     
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions     
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free     
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of     
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software     
Foundation.     
     
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free     
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author     
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free     
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes     
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals     
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and     
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.     
     
			    NO WARRANTY     
     
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY     
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN     
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES     
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED     
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF     
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS     
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE     
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,     
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.     
     
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING     
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR     
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,     
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING     
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED     
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY     
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER     
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE     
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.     
     
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     
     
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs     
     
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest     
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it     
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.     
     
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest     
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively     
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least     
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.     
     
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>     
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>     
     
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify     
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by     
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or     
    (at your option) any later version.     
     
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,     
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of     
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     
    GNU General Public License for more details.     
     
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along     
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,     
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.     
     
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.     
     
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this     
when it starts in an interactive mode:     
     
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author     
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.     
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it     
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.     
     
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate     
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may     
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be     
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.     
     
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your     
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if     
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:     
     
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program     
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.     
     
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989     
  Ty Coon, President of Vice     
     
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into     
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may     
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the     
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General     
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
 
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA  
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  
  
			    Preamble  
  
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your  
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public  
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free  
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This  
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software  
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to  
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by  
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to  
your programs, too.  
  
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it  
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it  
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  
  
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid  
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you  
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.  
  
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that  
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their  
rights.  
  
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and  
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,  
distribute and/or modify the software.  
  
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain  
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free  
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we  
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so  
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original  
authors' reputations.  
  
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software  
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free  
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the  
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any  
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.  
  
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  
modification follow.  
  
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  
  
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains  
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed  
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,  
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"  
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:  
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,  
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another  
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in  
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  
  
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not  
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of  
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program  
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the  
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).  
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.  
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's  
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you  
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate  
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the  
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;  
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License  
along with the Program.  
  
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and  
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion  
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and  
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1  
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  
  
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices  
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  
  
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in  
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any  
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third  
    parties under the terms of this License.  
  
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively  
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such  
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an  
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a  
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide  
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under  
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this  
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but  
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on  
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)  
  
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If  
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,  
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in  
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those  
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you  
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based  
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of  
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the  
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  
  
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest  
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to  
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or  
collective works based on the Program.  
  
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program  
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of  
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under  
the scope of this License.  
  
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,  
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of  
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:  
  
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable  
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections  
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,  
  
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three  
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your  
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete  
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be  
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium  
    customarily used for software interchange; or,  
  
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer  
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is  
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you  
    received the program in object code or executable form with such  
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)  
  
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for  
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source  
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any  
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to  
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a  
special exception, the source code distributed need not include  
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary  
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the  
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering  
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent  
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as  
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not  
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  
  
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program  
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt  
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is  
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under  
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such  
parties remain in full compliance.  
  
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not  
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or  
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are  
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by  
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the  
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and  
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying  
the Program or works based on it.  
  
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the  
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the  
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to  
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further  
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.  
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to  
this License.  
  
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent  
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),  
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot  
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you

license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by  
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then  
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to  
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.  
  
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under  
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in  
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the  
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License  
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding  
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among  
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates  
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  
  
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions  
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will  
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  
address new problems or concerns.  
  
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program  
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any  
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions  
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free  
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of  
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software  
Foundation.  
  
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free  
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author  
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free  
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes  
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals  
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and  
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  
  
			    NO WARRANTY  
  
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY  
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN  
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES  
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED  
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS  
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE  
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,  
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  
  
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR  
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,  
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING  
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED  
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY  
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER  
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  
  
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  
  
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  
  
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest  
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  
  
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>  
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>  
  
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify  
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by  
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or  
    (at your option) any later version.  
  
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,  
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the  
    GNU General Public License for more details.  
  
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along  
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,  
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.  
  
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  
  
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this  
when it starts in an interactive mode:  
  
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author  
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it  
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.  
  
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate  
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may  
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be  
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.  
  
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your  
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if  
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:  
  
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program  
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.  
  
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989  
  Ty Coon, President of Vice  
  
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into  
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may  
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the  
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General  
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

  ==============

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,    
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA    
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies    
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.    
    
			    Preamble    
    
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your    
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public    
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free    
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This    
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software    
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to    
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by    
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to    
your programs, too.    
    
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not    
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you    
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for    
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it    
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it    
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.    
    
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid    
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.    
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you    
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.    
    
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether    
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that    
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the    
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their    
rights.    
    
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and    
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,    
distribute and/or modify the software.    
    
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain    
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free    
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we    
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so    
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original    
authors' reputations.    
    
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software    
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free    
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the    
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any    
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.    
    
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and    
modification follow.    
    
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE    
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION    
    
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains    
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed    
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,    
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"    
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:    
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,    
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another    
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in    
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".    
    
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not    
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of    
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program    
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the    
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).    
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.    
    
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's    
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you    
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate    
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the    
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;    
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License    
along with the Program.    
    
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and    
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.    
    
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion    
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and    
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1    
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:    
    
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices    
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.    
    
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in    
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any    
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third    
    parties under the terms of this License.    
    
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively    
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such    
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an    
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a    
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide    
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under    
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this    
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but    
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on    
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)    
    
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If    
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,    
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in    
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those    
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you    
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based    
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of    
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the    
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.    
    
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest    
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to    
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or    
collective works based on the Program.    
    
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program    
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of    
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under    
the scope of this License.    
    
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,    
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of    
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:    
    
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable    
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections    
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,    
    
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three    
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your    
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete    
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be    
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium    
    customarily used for software interchange; or,    
    
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer    
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is    
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you    
    received the program in object code or executable form with such    
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)    
    
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for    
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source    
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any    
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to    
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a    
special exception, the source code distributed need not include    
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary    
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the    
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component    
itself accompanies the executable.    
    
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering    
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent    
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as    
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not    
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.    
    
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program    
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt    
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is    
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.    
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under    
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such    
parties remain in full compliance.    
    
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not    
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or    
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are    
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by    
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the    
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and    
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying    
the Program or works based on it.    
    
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the    
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the    
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to    
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further    
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.    
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to    
this License.    
    
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent    
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),    
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or    
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not    
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot    
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this    
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you    
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent    
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by    
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then    
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to    
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.    
    
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under    
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to    
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other    
circumstances.    
    
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any    
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any    
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the    
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is    
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made    
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed    
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that    
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing    
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot    
impose that choice.    
    
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to    
be a consequence of the rest of this License.    
    
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in    
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the    
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License    
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding    
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among    
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates    
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.    
    
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions    
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will    
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to    
address new problems or concerns.    
    
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program    
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any    
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions    
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free    
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of    
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software    
Foundation.    
    
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free    
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author    
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free    
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes    
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals    
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and    
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.    
    
			    NO WARRANTY    
    
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY    
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN    
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES    
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED    
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF    
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS    
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE    
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,    
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    
    
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING    
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR    
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,    
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING    
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED    
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY    
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER    
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE    
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.    
    
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS    
    
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs    
    
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest    
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it    
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.    
    
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest    
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively    
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least    
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.    
    
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>    
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>    
    
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify    
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by    
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or    
    (at your option) any later version.    
    
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,    
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of    
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the    
    GNU General Public License for more details.    
    
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along    
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,    
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.    
    
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.    
    
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this    
when it starts in an interactive mode:    
    
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author    
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.    
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it    
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.    
    
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate    
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may    
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be    
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.    
    
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your    
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if    
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:    
    
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program    
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.    
    
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989    
  Ty Coon, President of Vice    
    
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into    
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may    
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the    
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General    
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   
		       Version 2, June 1991   
   
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,   
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA   
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies   
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.   
   
			    Preamble   
   
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your   
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public   
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free   
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This   
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software   
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to   
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by   
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to   
your programs, too.   
   
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not   
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you   
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for   
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it   
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it   
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.   
   
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid   
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.   
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you   
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.   
   
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether   
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that   
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the   
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their   
rights.   
   
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and   
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,   
distribute and/or modify the software.   
   
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain   
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free   
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we   
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so   
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original   
authors' reputations.   
   
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software   
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free   
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the   
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any   
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.   
   
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and   
modification follow.   
   
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION   
   
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains   
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed   
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,   
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"   
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:   
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,   
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another   
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in   
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".   
   
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not   
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of   
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program   
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the   
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).   
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.   
   
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's   
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you   
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate   
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the   
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;   
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License   
along with the Program.   
   
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and   
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.   
   
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion   
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and   
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1   
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:   
   
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices   
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.   
   
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in   
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any   
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third   
    parties under the terms of this License.   
   
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively   
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such   
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an   
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a   
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide   
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under   
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this   
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but   
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on   
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)   
   
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If   
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,   
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in   
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those   
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you   
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based   
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of   
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the   
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.   
   
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest   
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to   
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or   
collective works based on the Program.   
   
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program   
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of   
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under   
the scope of this License.   
   
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,   
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of   
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:   
   
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable   
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections   
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,   
   
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three   
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your   
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete   
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be   
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium   
    customarily used for software interchange; or,   
   
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer   
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is   
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you   
    received the program in object code or executable form with such   
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)   
   
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for   
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source   
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any   
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to   
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a   
special exception, the source code distributed need not include   
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary   
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the   
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component   
itself accompanies the executable.   
   
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering   
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent   
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as   
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not   
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.   
   
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program   
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt   
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is   
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.   
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under   
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such   
parties remain in full compliance.   
   
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not   
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or   
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are   
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by   
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the   
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and   
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying   
the Program or works based on it.   
   
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the   
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the   
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to   
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further   
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.   
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to   
this License.   
   
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent   
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),   
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or   
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not   
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot   
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this   
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you   
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent   
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by   
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then   
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to   
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.   
   
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under   
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to   
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other   
circumstances.   
   
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any   
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any   
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the   
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is   
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made   
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed   
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that   
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing   
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot   
impose that choice.   
   
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to   
be a consequence of the rest of this License.   
   
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in   
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the   
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License   
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding   
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among   
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates   
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.   
   
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions   
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will   
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to   
address new problems or concerns.   
   
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program   
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any   
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions   
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free   
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of   
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software   
Foundation.   
   
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free   
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author   
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free   
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes   
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals   
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and   
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.   
   
			    NO WARRANTY   
   
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY   
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN   
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES   
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED   
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF   
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS   
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE   
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,   
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.   
   
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING   
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR   
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,   
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING   
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED   
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY   
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER   
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE   
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.   
   
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS   
   
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs   
   
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest   
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it   
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.   
   
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest   
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively   
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least   
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.   
   
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>   
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>   
   
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify   
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by   
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or   
    (at your option) any later version.   
   
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,   
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of   
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the   
    GNU General Public License for more details.   
   
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along   
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,   
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.   
   
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.   
   
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this   
when it starts in an interactive mode:   
   
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author   
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.   
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it   
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.   
   
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate   
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may   
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be   
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.   
   
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your   
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if   
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:   
   
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program   
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.   
   
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989   
  Ty Coon, President of Vice   
   
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into   
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may   
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the   
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General   
Public License instead of this License.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
		       Version 2, June 1991 
 
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA 
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
			    Preamble 
 
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public 
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This 
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to 
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by 
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to 
your programs, too. 
 
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not 
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you 
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for 
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it 
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it 
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. 
 
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether 
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that 
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights. 
 
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the software. 
 
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we 
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so 
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
authors' reputations. 
 
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software 
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free 
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the 
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any 
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow. 
  
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains 
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed 
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, 
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" 
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: 
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, 
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another 
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in 
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of 
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program 
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
 
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's 
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the 
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion 
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and 
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 
 
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices 
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any 
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third 
    parties under the terms of this License. 
 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively 
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such 
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an 
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a 
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide 
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under 
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this 
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but 
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on 
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 
  
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, 
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of 
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
the scope of this License. 
 
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, 
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your 
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete 
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
    customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer 
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is 
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you 
    received the program in object code or executable form with such 
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source 
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a 
special exception, the source code distributed need not include 
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as 
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 
compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
  
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is 
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under 
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such 
parties remain in full compliance. 
 
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
 
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further 
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to 
this License. 
 
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot 
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent 
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by 
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then 
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is 
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made 
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
be a consequence of the rest of this License. 
  
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License 
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding 
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates 
the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 
 
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of 
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation. 
 
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author 
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes 
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals 
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
			    NO WARRANTY 
 
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY 
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN 
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE 
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  
	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest 
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least 
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author> 
 
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify 
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by 
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or 
    (at your option) any later version. 
 
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, 
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of 
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the 
    GNU General Public License for more details. 
 
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License 
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software 
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. 
 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this 
when it starts in an interactive mode: 
 
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author 
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'. 
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it 
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details. 
 
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may 
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names: 
 
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker. 
 
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 
  Ty Coon, President of Vice 
 
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General 
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
                          59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111 USA 
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
			    Preamble 
 
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public 
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This 
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to 
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by 
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to 
your programs, too. 
 
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not 
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you 
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for 
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it 
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it 
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. 
 
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether 
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that 
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights. 
 
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the software. 
 
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we 
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so 
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
authors' reputations. 
 
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software 
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free 
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the 
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any 
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow. 
  
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains 
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed 
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, 
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" 
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: 
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, 
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another 
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in 
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of 
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program 
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
 
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's 
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the 
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion 
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and 
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 
 
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices 
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any 
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third 
    parties under the terms of this License. 
 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively 
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such 
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an 
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a 
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide 
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under 
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this 
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but 
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on 
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 
  
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, 
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of 
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
the scope of this License. 
 
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, 
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your 
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete 
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
    customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer 
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is 
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you 
    received the program in object code or executable form with such 
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source 
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a 
special exception, the source code distributed need not include 
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable. 
 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as 
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 
compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
  
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is 
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under 
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such 
parties remain in full compliance. 
 
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
 
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further 
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to 
this License. 
 
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot 
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent 
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by 
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then 
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is 
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made 
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
be a consequence of the rest of this License. 
  
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License 
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding 
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates 
the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 
 
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of 
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation. 
 
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author 
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes 
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals 
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
			    NO WARRANTY 
 
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY 
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN 
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE 
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  
	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest 
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least 
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author> 
 
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify 
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by 
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or 
    (at your option) any later version. 
 
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, 
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of 
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the 
    GNU General Public License for more details. 
 
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License 
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software 
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA 
 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this 
when it starts in an interactive mode: 
 
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author 
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'. 
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it 
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details. 
 
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may 
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names: 
 
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker. 
 
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 
  Ty Coon, President of Vice 
 
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General 
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

Copying
-------

All software included in this package is Copyright 2002 Roaring
Penguin Software Inc.  You may distribute it under the terms of the
GNU General Public License (the "GPL"), Version 2, or (at your option)
any later version.

Handlers
--------

Part of the l2tp code is implemented in the l2tpd program, and part of
it is implemented as "handlers".  A handler is a shared-object library
which is dynamically linked into l2tpd at run-time using the
"load-handler" configuration directive.

Although the handlers included with this package (sync-pppd and cmd)
are licensed under the GPL, as a special exception, you may write your
own handlers which link to code in this package and not release them
under the GPL.  There may be other reasons why your handlers must
be released under the GPL (for example, they may link with other GPL'd
code), but in the absence of other reasons, you may keep your handlers
proprietary.

Installation
------------

./configure && make
make install

Now read l2tpd(8) and l2tp.conf(5)</pre></p>

source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007  
  
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>  
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  
  
                            Preamble  
  
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for  
software and other kinds of works.  
  
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed  
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,  
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to  
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free  
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the  
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to  
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to  
your programs, too.  
  
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you  
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new  
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  
  
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you  
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have  
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if  
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.  
  
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same  
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive  
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they  
know their rights.  
  
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:  
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License  
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.  
  
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains  
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and  
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as  
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to  
authors of previous versions.  
  
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run  
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer  
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of  
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic  
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to  
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we  
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those  
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we  
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions  
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.  
  
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of  
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to  
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could  
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that  
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.  
  
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  
modification follow.  
  
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
  0. Definitions.  
  
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  
  
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of  
works, such as semiconductor masks.  
  
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this  
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and  
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.  
  
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work  
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an  
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the  
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.  
  
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based  
on the Program.  
  
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without  
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for  
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a  
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,  
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the  
public, and in some countries other activities as well.  
  
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other  
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through  
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.  
  
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"  
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible  
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)  
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the  
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the  
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If  
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a  
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.  
  
  1. Source Code.  
  
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work  
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source  
form of a work.  
  
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official  
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of  
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that  
is widely used among developers working in that language.  
  
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other  
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of  
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major  
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that  
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an  
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A  
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component  
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system  
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to  
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.  
  
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all  
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable  
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to  
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's  
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free  
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but  
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source  
includes interface definition files associated with source files for  
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically  
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,  
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those  
subprograms and other parts of the work.  
  
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users  
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding  
Source.  
  
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that  
same work.  
  
  2. Basic Permissions.  
  
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of  
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated  
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited  
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a  
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its  
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your  
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.  
  
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not  
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains  
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose  
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you  
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with  
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do  
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works  
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction  
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of  
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.  
  
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under  
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10  
makes it unnecessary.  
  
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.  
  
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological  
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article  
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or  
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such  
measures.  
  
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid  
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention  
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to  
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or  
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's  
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of  
technological measures.  
  
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.  
  
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you  
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and  
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;  
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any  
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;  
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all  
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.  
  
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,  
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.  
  
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.  
  
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to  
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the  
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  
  
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified  
    it, and giving a relevant date.  
  
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is  
    released under this License and any conditions added under section  
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to  
    "keep intact all notices".  
  
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this  
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This  
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7  
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,  
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no  
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not  
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.  
  
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display  
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive  
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your  
    work need not make them do so.  
  
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent  
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,  
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,  
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an  
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not  
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users  
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work  
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other  
parts of the aggregate.  
  
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.  
  
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms  
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the  
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,  
in one of these ways:  
  
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product  
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the  
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium  
    customarily used for software interchange.  
  
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product  
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a  
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as  
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product  
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a  
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the  
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical  
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no  
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this  
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the  
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.  
  
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the  
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This  
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and  
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord  
    with subsection 6b.  
  
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated  
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the  
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no  
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the  
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to  
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source  
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)  
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain  
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the  
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the  
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is  
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.  
  
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided  
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding  
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no  
    charge under subsection 6d.  
  
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded  
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be  
included in conveying the object code work.  
  
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any  
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,  
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation  
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,  
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular  
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a  
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status  
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user  
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product  
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial  
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent  
the only significant mode of use of the product.  
  
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,  
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install  
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from  
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must  
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object  
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because  
modification has been made.  
  
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or  
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as  
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the  
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a  
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the  
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied  
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply  
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install  
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has  
been installed in ROM).  
  
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a  
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates  
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for  
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a  
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and  
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and  
protocols for communication across the network.  
  
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,  
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly  
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in  
source code form), and must require no special password or key for  
unpacking, reading or copying.  
  
  7. Additional Terms.  
  
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this  
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall  
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent  
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions  
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately  
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by  
this License without regard to the additional permissions.  
  
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option  
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of  
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own  
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place  
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,  
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.  
  
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you  
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of  
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:  
  
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the  
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or  
  
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or  
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal  
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or  
  
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or  
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in  
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or  
  
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or  
    authors of the material; or  
  
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some  
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or  
  
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that  
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of  
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for  
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on  
    those licensors and authors.  
  
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further  
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you  
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is  
governed by this License along with a term that is a further  
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains  
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this  
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms  
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does  
not survive such relicensing or conveying.  
  
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you  
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the  
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating  
where to find the applicable terms.  
  
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the  
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;  
the above requirements apply either way.  
  
  8. Termination.  
  
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly  
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or  
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under  
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third  
paragraph of section 11).  
  
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your  
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)  
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and  
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright  
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means  
prior to 60 days after the cessation.  
  
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is  
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the  
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have  
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that  
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after  
your receipt of the notice.  
  
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the  
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under  
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently  
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same  
material under section 10.  
  
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.  
  
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or  
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work  
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission  
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,  
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or  
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do  
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a  
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.  
  
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.  
  
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically  
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and  
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible  
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  
  
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an  
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an  
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered  
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that  
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever  
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could  
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the  
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if  
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.  
  
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the  
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may  
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of  
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation  
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that  
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for  
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.  
  
  11. Patents.  
  
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this  
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The  
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".  
  
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims  
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or  
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted  
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,  
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a  
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For  
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant  
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of  
this License.  
  
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free  
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to  
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and  
propagate the contents of its contributor version.  
  
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express  
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent  
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to  
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a  
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a  
patent against the party.  
  
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,  
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone  
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a  
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,  
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so  
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the  
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner  
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent  
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have  
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the  
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work  
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that  
country that you have reason to believe are valid.  
  
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or  
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a  
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties  
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify  
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license  
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered  
work and works based on it.  
  
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within  
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is  
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are  
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered  
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is  
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment  
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying  
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the  
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory  
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work  
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily  
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that  
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,  
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.  
  
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting  
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may  
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.  
  
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.  
  
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a  
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may  
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you  
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey  
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this  
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.  
  
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.  
  
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have  
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed  
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single  
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this  
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,  
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,  
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the  
combination as such.  
  
  14. Revised Versions of this License.  
  
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of  
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will  
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  
address new problems or concerns.  
  
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the  
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General  
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the  
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered  
version or of any later version published by the Free Software  
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the  
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published  
by the Free Software Foundation.  
  
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future  
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's  
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you  
to choose that version for the Program.  
  
  Later license versions may give you additional or different  
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any  
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a  
later version.  
  
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.  
  
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY  
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT  
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY  
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,  
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM  
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF  
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  
  
  16. Limitation of Liability.  
  
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS  
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY  
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE  
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF  
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD  
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),  
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF  
SUCH DAMAGES.  
  
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.  
  
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided  
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,  
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates  
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the  
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a  
copy of the Program in return for a fee.  
  
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  
  
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  
  
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest  
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  
  
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>  
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>  
  
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify  
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by  
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or  
    (at your option) any later version.  
  
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,  
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the  
    GNU General Public License for more details.  
  
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License  
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  
  
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  
  
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short  
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  
  
    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>  
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it  
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.  
  
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate  
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands  
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".  
  
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,  
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see  
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  
  
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program  
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you  
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with  
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General  
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

Traceroute is a system administrators utility to trace the route 
ip packets from the current system take in getting to some 
destination system.  See the comments at the front of the 
program for a description of its use. 
 
This program uses raw ip sockets and must be run as root (or installed 
setuid to root). 
 
A couple of awk programs to massage the traceroute output are 
included.  "mean.awk" and "median.awk" compute the mean and median time 
to each hop, respectively.  I've found that something like 
 
    traceroute -q 7 foo.somewhere >t 
    awk -f median.awk t | xgraph 
 
can give you a quick picture of the bad spots on a long path (median is 
usually a better noise filter than mean). 
 
Problems, bugs, questions, desirable enhancements, source code 
contributions, etc., should be sent to the email address 
"traceroute@ee.lbl.gov".</pre></p>

		       Version 2, June 1991     
     
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,     
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA     
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies     
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.     
     
			    Preamble     
     
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your     
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public     
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free     
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This     
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software     
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to     
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by     
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to     
your programs, too.     
     
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not     
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you     
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for     
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it     
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it     
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.     
     
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid     
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.     
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you     
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.     
     
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether     
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that     
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the     
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their     
rights.     
     
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and     
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,     
distribute and/or modify the software.     
     
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain     
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free     
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we     
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so     
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original     
authors' reputations.     
     
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software     
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free     
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the     
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any     
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.     
     
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and     
modification follow.     
     
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE     
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION     
     
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains     
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed     
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,     
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"     
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:     
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,     
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another     
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in     
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".     
     
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not     
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of     
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program     
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the     
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).     
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.     
     
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's     
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you     
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate     
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the     
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;     
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License     
along with the Program.     
     
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and     
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.     
     
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion     
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and     
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1     
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:     
     
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices     
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.     
     
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in     
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any     
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third     
    parties under the terms of this License.     
     
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively     
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such     
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an     
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a     
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide     
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under     
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this     
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but     
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on     
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)     
     
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If     
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,     
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in     
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those     
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you     
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based     
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of     
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the     
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.     
     
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest     
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to     
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or     
collective works based on the Program.     
     
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program     
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of     
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under     
the scope of this License.     
     
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,     
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of     
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:     
     
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable     
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections     
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,     
     
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three     
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your     
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete     
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be     
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium     
    customarily used for software interchange; or,     
     
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer     
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is     
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you     
    received the program in object code or executable form with such     
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)     
     
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for     
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source     
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any     
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to     
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a     
special exception, the source code distributed need not include     
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary     
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the     
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component     
itself accompanies the executable.     
     
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering     
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent     
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as     
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not     
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.     
     
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program     
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt     
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is     
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.     
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under     
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such     
parties remain in full compliance.     
     
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not     
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or     
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are     
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by     
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the     
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and     
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying     
the Program or works based on it.     
     
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the     
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the     
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to     
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further     
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.     
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to     
this License.     
     
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent     
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),     
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or     
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not     
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot     
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this     
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you     
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent     
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by     
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then     
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to     
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.     
     
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under     
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to     
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other     
circumstances.     
     
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any     
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any     
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the     
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is     
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made     
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed     
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that     
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing     
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot     
impose that choice.     
     
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to     
be a consequence of the rest of this License.     
     
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in     
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the     
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License     
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding     
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among     
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates     
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.     
     
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions     
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will     
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to     
address new problems or concerns.     
     
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program     
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any     
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions     
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free     
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of     
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software     
Foundation.     
     
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free     
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author     
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free     
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes     
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals     
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and     
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.     
     
			    NO WARRANTY     
     
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY     
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN     
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES     
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED     
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF     
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS     
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE     
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,     
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.     
     
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING     
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR     
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,     
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING     
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED     
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY     
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER     
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE     
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.     
     
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     
     
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs     
     
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest     
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it     
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.     
     
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest     
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively     
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least     
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.     
     
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>     
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>     
     
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify     
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by     
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or     
    (at your option) any later version.     
     
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,     
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of     
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     
    GNU General Public License for more details.     
     
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along     
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,     
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.     
     
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.     
     
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this     
when it starts in an interactive mode:     
     
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author     
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.     
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it     
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.     
     
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate     
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may     
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be     
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.     
     
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your     
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if     
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:     
     
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program     
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.     
     
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989     
  Ty Coon, President of Vice     
     
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into     
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may     
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the     
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General     
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,   
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA   
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies   
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.   
   
			    Preamble   
   
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your   
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public   
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free   
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This   
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software   
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to   
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by   
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to   
your programs, too.   
   
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not   
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you   
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for   
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it   
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it   
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.   
   
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid   
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.   
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you   
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.   
   
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether   
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that   
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the   
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their   
rights.   
   
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and   
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,   
distribute and/or modify the software.   
   
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain   
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free   
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we   
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so   
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original   
authors' reputations.   
   
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software   
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free   
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the   
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any   
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.   
   
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and   
modification follow.   
   
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION   
   
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains   
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed   
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,   
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"   
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:   
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,   
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another   
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in   
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".   
   
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not   
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of   
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program   
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the   
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).   
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.   
   
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's   
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you   
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate   
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the   
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;   
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License   
along with the Program.   
   
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and   
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.   
   
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion   
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and   
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1   
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:   
   
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices   
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.   
   
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in   
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any   
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third   
    parties under the terms of this License.   
   
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively   
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such   
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an   
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a   
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide   
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under   
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this   
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but   
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on   
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)   
   
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If   
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,   
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in   
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those   
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you   
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based   
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of   
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the   
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.   
   
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest   
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to   
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or   
collective works based on the Program.   
   
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program   
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of   
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under   
the scope of this License.   
   
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,   
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of   
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:   
   
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable   
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections   
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,   
   
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three   
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your   
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete   
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be   
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium   
    customarily used for software interchange; or,   
   
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer   
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is   
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you   
    received the program in object code or executable form with such   
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)   
   
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for   
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source   
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any   
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to   
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a   
special exception, the source code distributed need not include   
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary   
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the   
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component   
itself accompanies the executable.   
   
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering   
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent   
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as   
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not   
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.   
   
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program   
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt   
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is   
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.   
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under   
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such   
parties remain in full compliance.   
   
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not   
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or   
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are   
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by   
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the   
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and   
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying   
the Program or works based on it.   
   
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the   
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the   
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to   
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further   
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.   
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to   
this License.   
   
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent   
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),   
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or   
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not   
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot   
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this   
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you   
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent   
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by   
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then   
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to   
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.   
   
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under   
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to   
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other   
circumstances.   
   
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any   
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any   
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the   
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is   
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made   
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed   
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that   
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing   
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot   
impose that choice.   
   
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to   
be a consequence of the rest of this License.   
   
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in   
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the   
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License   
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding   
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among   
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates   
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.   
   
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions   
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will   
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to   
address new problems or concerns.   
   
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program   
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any   
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions   
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free   
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of   
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software   
Foundation.   
   
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free   
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author   
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free   
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes   
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals   
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and   
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.   
   
			    NO WARRANTY   
   
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY   
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN   
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES   
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED   
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF   
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS   
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE   
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,   
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.   
   
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING   
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR   
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,   
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING   
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED   
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY   
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER   
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE   
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.   
   
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS   
   
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs   
   
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest   
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it   
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.   
   
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest   
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively   
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least   
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.   
   
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>   
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>   
   
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify   
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by   
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or   
    (at your option) any later version.   
   
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,   
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of   
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the   
    GNU General Public License for more details.   
   
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along   
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,   
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.   
   
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.   
   
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this   
when it starts in an interactive mode:   
   
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author   
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.   
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it   
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.   
   
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate   
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may   
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be   
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.   
   
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your   
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if   
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:   
   
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program   
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into   
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may   
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the   
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General   
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

		       Version 2, June 1991     
     
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,     
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA     
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies     
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.     
     
			    Preamble     
     
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your     
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public     
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free     
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This     
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software     
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to     
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by     
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to     
your programs, too.     
     
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not     
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you     
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for     
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it     
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it     
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.     
     
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid     
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.     
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you     
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.     
     
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether     
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that     
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the     
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their     
rights.     
     
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and     
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,     
distribute and/or modify the software.     
     
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain     
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free     
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we     
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so     
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original     
authors' reputations.     
     
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software     
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free     
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the     
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any     
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.     
     
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and     
modification follow.     
     
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE     
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION     
     
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains     
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed     
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,     
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"     
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:     
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,     
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another     
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in     
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".     
     
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not     
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of     
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program     
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the     
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).     
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.     
     
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's     
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you     
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate     
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the     
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;     
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License     
along with the Program.     
     
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and     
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.     
     
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion     
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and     
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1     
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:     
     
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices     
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.     
     
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in     
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any     
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third     
    parties under the terms of this License.     
     
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively     
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such     
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an     
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a     
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide     
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under     
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this     
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but     
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on     
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)     
     
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If     
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,     
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in     
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those     
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you     
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based     
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of     
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the     
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.     
     
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest     
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to     
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or     
collective works based on the Program.     
     
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program     
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of     
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under     
the scope of this License.     
     
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,     
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of     
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:     
     
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable     
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections     
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,     
     
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three     
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your     
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete     
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be     
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium     
    customarily used for software interchange; or,     
     
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer     
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is     
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you     
    received the program in object code or executable form with such     
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)     
     
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for     
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source     
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any     
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to     
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a     
special exception, the source code distributed need not include     
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary     
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the     
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component     
itself accompanies the executable.     
     
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering     
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent     
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as     
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not     
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.     
     
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program     
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt     
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is     
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.     
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under     
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such     
parties remain in full compliance.     
     
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not     
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or     
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are     
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by     
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the     
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and     
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying     
the Program or works based on it.     
     
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the     
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the     
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to     
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further     
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.     
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to     
this License.     
     
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent     
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),     
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or     
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not     
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot     
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this     
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you     
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent     
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by     
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then     
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to     
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.     
     
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under     
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to     
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other     
circumstances.     
     
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any     
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any     
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the     
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is     
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made     
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed     
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that     
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing     
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot     
impose that choice.     
     
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to     
be a consequence of the rest of this License.     
     
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in     
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the     
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License     
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding     
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among     
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates     
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.     
     
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions     
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will     
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to     
address new problems or concerns.     
     
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program     
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any     
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions     
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free     
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of     
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software     
Foundation.     
     
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free     
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author     
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free     
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes     
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals     
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and     
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.     
     
			    NO WARRANTY     
     
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY     
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN     
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES     
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED     
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF     
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS     
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE     
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,     
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.     
     
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING     
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR     
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,     
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING     
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED     
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY     
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER     
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE     
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.     
     
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     
     
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs     
     
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest     
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it     
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.     
     
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest     
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively     
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least     
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.     
     
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>     
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>     
     
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify     
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by     
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or     
    (at your option) any later version.     
     
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,     
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of     
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the     
    GNU General Public License for more details.     
     
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along     
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,     
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.     
     
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.     
     
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this     
when it starts in an interactive mode:     
     
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author     
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.     
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it     
    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.     
     
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate     
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may     
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be     
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.     
     
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your     
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if     
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:     
     
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program     
  'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into     
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may     
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the     
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General     
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.</pre></p>

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/.  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions.
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
1. Source Code.
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.
2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
7. Additional Terms.
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
11. Patents.
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.
14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright (c) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.
The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or 
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy. 
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. 
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. 
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. 
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. 
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. 
d) Do one of the following: 
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. 
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. 
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License. 
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

If you accept these license terms and you have fully met the Microsoft Windows Rally Program Condition, you have the rights below.   
  
1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. You may install, compile and use any number of copies of the Sample Code on your devices to design, develop and test your products.   
  
2. ADDITIONAL LICENSE RIGHTS AND REQUIREMENTS.   
  
     a. Right to Modify and Distribute.   
           
         i. Distributable Code. You may modify, copy, and distribute the Distributable Code so long as your distribution complies with the notice provisions of Section 3.2(b) of the Program Agreement as well as all applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement Distributable Code means the source and object code form of the Sample Code in conjunction with and as part of a Licensed Implementation incorporated into a Licensed Product (as such terms are defined in the Program Agreement).   
  
      ii. Third Party Distribution. This license above only provides: (a) the right to grant to OEM5 who purchase your products a sublicense to modify the Distributable Code but only as necessary to customize OEM products that incorporate your Licensed Products and only so long as the OEM and the modified Distributable Code complies with all terms and conditions of this Agreement; (b) the right to grant to any of your OEMs, distributors and dealers a license to make, sell, offer for sale and distribute an object code copy of the Distributable Code (or OEM modified Distributable Code) in accordance with all applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (c) the right to grant to any end user a license to use an object code copy of the Distributable Code (or OEM modified Distributable Code) in accordance with all applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement With respect to any license or sublicense granted by you pursuant to this Section 2: (i) the license or sublicense shall terminate immediately and automatically (i.e. without any notice or other action by either you or Microsoft) if this Agreement terminates or expires; (ii) the license or sublicense shall have terms and conditions which are consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Program Agreement; and (iii) you shall ensure that each licensee or sublicensee complies with the license requirements and all other applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Program Agreement   
  
     iii. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute or sublicense, you must   
  
	require distributors, OEM5 and end users to agree to terms that protect the Distributable Code at least as much as this Agreement prohibit reverse engineering of the Distributable Code to the extent permitted by applicable law and include disclaimers and limitations of any representations, warranties, damages and liabilities of Microsoft and its affiliates to the same extent that your representations, warranties, damages and liabilities are disclaimed or limited, provided that such disclaimers and warranties need not identify Microsoft or any of its affiliates by name;   
	display your valid copyright notice on your products; and   
	 indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys fees, related to the distribution or use of your products.

 use Microsofts trademarks in your products names or in a way that suggests your products come from or are endorsed by Microsoft, except as may be permitted by a separate written agreement with Microsoft;   
  
 include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful products; or   
  
 modify the source code of the Sample Code or modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that   
     the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or   
     others have the right to modify it.
